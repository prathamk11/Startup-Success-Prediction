# **Startup Success Prediction**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict whether a startup will be successful or not based on various business-related factors. We will train a machine learning model on a relevant dataset and evaluate its performance using different algorithms.

---

## **Dataset Selection**
A good dataset for this task would include features such as:
- **Funding Amount**  
- **Company Age**  
- **Number of Employees**  
- **Market/Industry Type**  
- **Location**  
- **Revenue**  
- **Growth Metrics**  
- **Competitor Count**  

You can find datasets on **Kaggle** or use a dataset like the "Startup Success Data" from online sources.

## **Steps to Build the Model**

### **1. Load the Dataset**
We will load a dataset containing startup data.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values  
- Converting categorical variables into numerical format  
- Normalization or Standardization if necessary  

### **3. Feature Selection**
- Identifying the most important features using **correlation matrix** or **feature importance**.

### **4. Model Training**
- Implementing **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification.

### **5. Model Evaluation**
- Checking accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## **Machine Learning Models Used**

### **1. Logistic Regression**  
- A simple classification algorithm based on the sigmoid function.
- Useful for binary classification problems.

### **2. Random Forest**  
- A powerful ensemble method using multiple decision trees.
- Helps improve accuracy and handles overfitting well.

### **3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- A robust classifier that works well with high-dimensional data.
- Uses a hyperplane to separate different classes.
